# Your GPA


### Is ...

- simply a _Grade Point Average_, meaning, it's just a freaking measure of center. That's all it is.


### Is supposed to tell me ...

- about your typical performance in the courses you've taken.


### Does not tell me ...

- the whole story of your academic performance.
- how much you know about certain topics.
- how successful you are (or can be).
- what is your personal worth.


### More important

- it does not tell me how valuable you are or can be as a person, son/daughter,  brother/sister, father/mother, husband/wife, friend, colleague, partner,
________ (fill-in the blank)


### In summary

Don't get obsessed that much about your GPA. Your GPA does not (and should not) define you. Trust me when I tell you that it won't be the decisive factor for your success in this life.
